Beautiful Soup doesnt work. So i tried using selenium .
you have to give the targeted user and put your credential of instagram in the code.
first the model will scrape 10 most recent posts, captions, captionid, iamge url etc.
this model works in real time it check the targeted profile every 3 mins .
